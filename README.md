This is a real project where the sales of a bakery product in Malaga for a day have been predicted 🗓️. To achieve this 💡, a series of steps have been carried out using my knowledge as a Data Scientist 👨‍💻, which includes everything from obtaining and loading the data, to establishing sales prediction models, through data processing and model training to make it as accurate as possible 💯.

After completing the model and its deployment 📈, a dashboard has been designed in Power BI to visualize the accuracy of the model, comparing actual sales with predicted ones ✔️.
